        <p>Hi everyone, I hope all of you are doing pretty well. When I was asked to say something about BSADD, the first thing that sprang in my mind is that, BSADD is the first of it's kind in Bangladesh in terms of student community that focuses on promoting Software Design and Development practices among students. </p>

        <p>The great thing about BSADD is that it's a well drilled organization run solely by the students. From managing weekly tutorial sessions to encouraging the use of cutting edge tools and organizing Software Design and Development Contests at national levels. You name it, BSADD has always been at the forefront of everything and students have always been at the heart of it. And that too from a sense of a dedication to our Department, giving something back.</p>

        <p>I have been fortunate enough to see all these great things I have told about BSADD from the very beginning. The aim of BSADD has always been to bridge the gap between industry and academia and give the students a sense of the practical scenario. It will be really unfair, if I do not acknowledge the contribution of the CSE'07 batch who established BSADD and made it all possible. From then 2008 batch took over the battle and took BSADD forward. I hope that 2009 batch is also doing a great job.</p>

        <p>So that's all I had to say about BSADD. I wish you all the best and I hope that BSADD will always remain as a success story and continue to thrive.</p>
