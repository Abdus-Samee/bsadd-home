    <hr/>
    <p>BUET has an outstanding image on Programming Contest in local and global platforms for years. For competitive programming contest, we have teams who get extensive training and motivation from some of our amazing ex-contestants and they participate in various local and global contests regularly. But the picture was somewhat different for software analysis/development. A couple of years back we had no organized way of getting trained in software development. We got some success stories in different development contests, but those were mostly result of personal efforts. There was very limited scope of sharing the knowledge we had for not having a organized effort or a community. To diminish this lacking of an organized effort and proper direction, BSADD was born.</p>
    <p>The main goal of BSADD is creating a platform, where we can learn and share the knowledge about the best practices in software development. It serves as a community where the software enthusiasts participate and share their expertise to bridge the gap between our students and the industry. BSADD arranges training sessions, contests, design challenges in online and offline platform focusing on software design, research in regular basis. It also guides the students who participate in local and international contests. Our motto is growing the culture of software design and development among the students.</p>
    <p>From its inception BSADD has been arranging various training sessions, contests, design challenges from time to time. On  a regular basis we invite professionals from the industry, so that we can always be up to date with the state-of-art methods. By creating a helpful learning environment, BSADD paves the way for a skilled software development community.</p>
