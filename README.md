steps for inserting new session gallery: 
    - create new folder and name it as you wish 
    - put all images under that folder
    - if you have thumbnails for your pictures, put them inside img/timg folder with the same name as original image folder. 
    - insert necesary metadata in _data/gallery.yml file

        (please note that if you don't have any thumbnails folder, you have to specify that in .yml by assigning empty string to thumbFolder variable i.e. `thumbFolder: ""` )
